# Cashless cards system

Congratulations on choosing Cashless cards as your internal transaction  
system. Its a clean, lightweight web application designed to provide a 
cashless service in a "closed" environment, such as offices, clinics, and 
schools, using NFC capable ID cards or an otherwise unique customer number. 

## Set up



## Permissions

The system limits certain functionality based on a user's permissions. These 
can be assigned at the individual user level or at group. We strongly 
recommend working at the group level as we've found it much easier to manage 
this way. 

The permissions used by cashless cards are: 


## Customers



## Vouchers



## Transactions
